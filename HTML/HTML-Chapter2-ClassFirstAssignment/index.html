			<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>

			<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

			<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
			an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
			of <i> Nature </i>, <i> New Scientist </i>,  and all
			the other <br /> scientific journals her work had
			appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite> On
			The Road </cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
			college, and the longer she <br /> spent in these
			four walls the more she felt she needed to be
			free.</p>

			<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
			sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
			proclaiming that <q> Work is the refuge of
			people who have <br /> nothing better to do </q>. Although
			many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
			the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid"> DNA </abbr>, to be an
			outstanding achievement, Molly <br /> <em> did </em> think
			she had something better to do.</p>
